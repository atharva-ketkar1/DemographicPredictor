FIRST IMPLEMENTATION:
CNN with 3 Convolutional Blocks with Conv2D and MaxPooling.It then Flattens and goes to 3 Fully Connected Layers(Age, Gender, Race) with Dropout(0.3) to try and combat overfitting.

results:
148/148 [==============================] - 7s 49ms/step - loss: 97.0403 - age_output_loss: 95.8356 - gender_output_loss: 0.3320 - race_output_loss: 0.8728 - age_output_mae: 7.3400 - gender_output_accuracy: 0.8676 - race_output_accuracy: 0.7128

~ This means that the model is able to predict the age of a person where the age is off by approximately 7.34 years. Gender accuracy is 86.8% and Race accuracy is 71.3%

SECOND IMPLEMENTATION:
CNN with 4 Convolutional Blocks with Conv2D, BatchNormalization, and MaxPooling. It then Flattens and goes to 3 Fully Connected Layers(Age, Gender, Race) with Dropout(0.5) to try and combat overfitting.
